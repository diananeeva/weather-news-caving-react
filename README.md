# Full React Application with Weather and News Features

This is a full-stack React application featuring two main sections: a **Weather App** and a **News Detail App**. The Weather App allows users to check weather data for any given city, while the News Detail section displays individual news articles with detailed information and, in some cases, a registration form.

## Features

### Weather App
- Search for weather by city name.
- Displays temperature in Celsius, weather description, and humidity.
- Displays error messages when a city is not found.
- Responsive design: the app adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Uses the OpenWeather API for real-time weather data.

### News App
- Displays detailed news articles.
- Includes registration forms for specific news (e.g., expedition signup).
- Responsive design: dynamically adjusts for smaller screens (tablets and mobile).

### Contact Form with Google Maps
- Users can submit their name, email, interests, and message through the contact form.
- Validates the email input and shows a success message upon successful form submission.
- Includes a Google Maps iframe to show the business location.
- Responsive design that adapts for all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
